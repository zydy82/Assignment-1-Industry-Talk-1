- **Reflection:**      
Creating this poster was a deeply insightful experience, offering a comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving landscape of ICT jobs in the industry. As I researched various roles, I gained a clearer understanding of the diverse skill sets and qualifications needed in today's tech-driven world. Analyzing how these roles fit into the broader ICT ecosystem helped me connect academic concepts with real-world applications, providing a context for the knowledge I am acquiring in my course. This reflection made me realize the increasing demand for both technical and soft skills, such as problem-solving, communication, and teamwork, which are indispensable in today's workforce. Collaborating with my team for this assignment further enriched my experience, as it not only improved my communication skills but also enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively with diverse viewpoints and ideas. Working together, we were able to create a polished and cohesive final product that effectively conveyed the dynamic nature of ICT careers. This experience has motivated me to evaluate my own skillset and identify areas where I need to grow to better prepare myself for the industry.
